- 👋 Hi, I’m @sp3cni
-  My main focus is control engineering, simulations of physical processes and dynamic programming / optimality
-  Other interest in programming include game dev.

  I habitually overengineer my code and spam dataclasses wherever I can...
  
  
  Languages I can deal with include: Python3, C and C++ 
  and no, I came to Python from C++ back in 2012 so suck it up Jimmy boy.
